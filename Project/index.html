            Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a
            shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger
            teams, <br />
            the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per
            side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). <br />
            Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or
            on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.
            <br />
            Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and
            landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
            <br />
            <br />
            The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic
            projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other
            sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing
            the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a
            high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The
            flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
            <br />
            <br />
            The game developed in British India from the earlier game of
            battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by
            Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent
            competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a
            Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's
            singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles; mixed doubles was added
            four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands
            excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility,
            strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport,
            requiring good motor coordination and the development of
            sophisticated racquet movements.

          <h1>1. Lin Dan</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lin Dan</span> (born 14 October
            1983) is a Chinese former professional badminton player. He is a
            two-time Olympic champion, five-time World champion, as well as a
            six-time All England champion. <br />

            Widely regarded as the greatest badminton player of all time, by the
            age of 28 Lin had completed the "Super Grand Slam", having won what
            some consider to be the nine major titles in the badminton world:
            Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup, Thomas Cup, Sudirman
            Cup, Super Series Masters Finals, All England Open, Asian Games, and
            Asian Championships, becoming the first and only player to achieve
            this feat.
            <br />
            <br />
            He also became the first men's singles player to retain the Olympic
            gold medal by winning in 2008 and successfully defending his title
            in 2012. In 2004, he was dubbed "Super Dan" by opponent Peter Gade
            after winning the All England Open final, and the nickname has since
            been widely used by his fans as well as the media to refer to him,
            in recognition of his achievements.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lee Chong Wei</span> DB, DCSM, PJN,
            DSPN, AMN, JP, PhD(SptsSc) (h.c.) (born 21 October 1982) is a
            Malaysian former badminton player. As a singles player, Lee was
            ranked first worldwide for 349 weeks, including a 199-week streak
            from 21 August 2008 to 14 June 2012. He is the fifth Malaysian
            player after Foo Kok Keong, Rashid Sidek, Roslin Hashim and Wong
            Choong Hann to achieve such a ranking (since official rankings were
            first kept in the 1980s), and is the only Malaysian shuttler who has
            held the number one ranking for more than a year.
            <br />
            <br />

            Lee is a triple silver medalist at the Olympic Games, and the sixth
            Malaysian to win an Olympic medal. He won his first silver medal in
            2008, also the first time a Malaysian had reached the finals in the
            men's singles event. This achievement earned him the title Datuk,
            and led to then Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak describing him
            as national hero. He repeated the achievement twice more in 2012 and
            2016, thus making him the most successful Malaysian Olympian in
            history.

          <h1>3. Viktor Axelsen</h1>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Viktor Axelsen</span> (born 4
            January 1994) is a Danish badminton player. He is the 2017 World
            champion and the 2020 Olympic champion. He won the 2010 World Junior
            Championships, beating South Korea's Kang Ji-wook in the final to
            become the first ever European singles player to hold the title.
            Axelsen is a three-time European champion, having won the title in
            2016, 2018 and 2022. Axelsen started the 2022 season as the world
            number one on the BWF World Ranking. He reached the semi-finals of
            the German Open 2022 where he narrowly lost in three games (13-21,
            21-12, 20-22) to Indian player Lakshya Sen.

            <br />
            <br />
            On March 20, Axelsen won the All England Open in convincing fashion
            without dropping a single game in the entire tournament. He defeated
            Lakshya Sen in the finals (21-10, 21-15). On 30 April, Axelsen won
            his third European Championship by defeating compatriot Anders
            Antonsen, 21–17, 21–15, in Madrid, Spain. He joined Flemming Delfs,
            Poul-Erik Høyer and Peter Gade as Danish three-time winners in men's
            singles. Despite the win, Axelsen was not satisfied with the win,
            saying that there were many silly mistakes from both players. On
            July 3, Axelsen won the Malaysia Open for the first time by
            defeating his nemesis Momota 21-4, 21-7 in the final, becoming the
            first Dane to win the event in 15 years. The next day, Axelsen
            withdrew from the 2022 Malaysia Masters, which was the next event on
            the tour. Axelsen then withdrew from the Singapore Open, taking a
            break in Singapore before moving on to the World Championships in
            August.
