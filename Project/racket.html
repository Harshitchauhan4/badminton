        Choosing the correct or best badminton racquet for yourself can be
        daunting at first. With such a wide range of rackets from a variety of
        brands to choose from, it can be difficult to know where to start. We
        believe this decision can be narrowed down to two key questions; what
        type of balance the racket has, and how flexible the shaft is. Beyond
        this, many of the brands have rackets that cater to each combination of
        these factors, and you can then filter through them based on price and
        other factors.

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Head-Heavy</span> badminton rackets are very popular with players who like to
                play a powerful game from the back of the court, providing them with
                extra mass in the head, which can increase the power of their clears and
                smashes. As these types of shots are integral to badminton rallies,
                players who are looking to ensure they can consistently produce lengthy
                clears should consider purchasing a Head-Heavy racket.

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Head-Light</span> badminton rackets, by comparison, are more suitable for club players who play doubles far more than singles. The advantage of using a head-light racket is that the head and frame have far less mass and are therefore much easier to manipulate and swing. This is crucial when defending against opposing smashes, as you will need to react as quickly as possible to return the smash. By the same principle, Head-Light rackets are also much more desirable when playing shots at the net, particularly if you look to finish off rallies at the front of the court. If you prefer to play driving, fast and attacking badminton when playing doubles, or are a singles player who has excellent technique and swing speed, you should seriously consider a Head-Light racket.

              ">
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Even-Balance</span> rackets, as you may suspect, are designed to provide a middle ground between Head-Heavy and Head-Light rackets, and attempt to offer the advantages of both, giving you enough power from the back and enough control & manoeuvrability at the front. If you have no preference between playing at the net and playing at the back, or are unsure, then an Even-Balance racket is the best choice, as the racket will be suitable for all types of shots. The majority of regular players now carry rackets for different scenarios, so if you are looking to start playing, then an Even-Balance racket will help you develop an all-round game. Additionally, if you are a more advanced player or play singles and doubles frequently, then you may also consider purchasing an even-balance racket to give you something that will help in every scenario.
